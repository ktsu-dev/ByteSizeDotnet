# Include dedicated page for design guidelines (2025-06-08 12:47:02)

_**User**_

the curriculum should contain a dedicated page similar to the quick reference for the microsoft design and style guidelines for dotnet libraries and applications

---

_**Assistant**_



---

I'll help you create a dedicated page for Microsoft design and style guidelines for .NET libraries and applications. Let me first explore the current curriculum structure to understand the format and then create the reference page.

Great! I can see there's already a `quick-reference.md` file. Let me examine it to understand the format and style, so I can create a similar page for Microsoft design and style guidelines.

---

Read file: curriculum/quick-reference.md

---

Now let me see a bit more to understand the complete structure, then I'll create the Microsoft design and style guidelines reference.

---

Read file: curriculum/quick-reference.md

---

Perfect! Now I understand the structure and style. I'll create a comprehensive Microsoft design and style guidelines reference page that follows the same format. This will be a valuable addition to the curriculum.

---



---

Let me create the file as a new file since it doesn't exist yet:

---



---

Let me create the file using a different approach to ensure it gets created:

---

```bash
cd "C:\dev\MoshpitGames\dotnet-bytesize\curriculum" && type nul > dotnet-design-guidelines.md
```

```
C:\dev\MoshpitGames\dotnet-bytesize>cd "C:\dev\MoshpitGames\dotnet-bytesize\curriculum" && type nul > dotnet-design-guidelines
.md

.md

C:\dev\MoshpitGames\dotnet-bytesize\curriculum>




















C:\dev\MoshpitGames\dotnet-bytesize\curriculum>
```

---

Now let me add the content to the file:

---



---

Perfect! I've successfully created the **Microsoft .NET Design and Style Guidelines** reference page for your curriculum. This comprehensive guide includes:

## Key Sections Created:

1. **📏 Official Naming Conventions** - Complete table of Microsoft's official naming rules for all .NET elements
2. **🎯 Type Design Guidelines** - When to use classes vs structs, abstract classes vs interfaces, and immutability patterns
3. **🔧 Member Design Guidelines** - Best practices for properties, methods, and events
4. **🛡️ Error Handling Guidelines** - Exception design patterns and nullable reference types
5. **🚀 Performance Guidelines** - Collection and async/await best practices
6. **📦 Library Design Guidelines** - API surface design and versioning strategies
7. **🏗️ Framework Design Patterns** - Common patterns like Builder and Factory
8. **📋 Code Organization Guidelines** - Project structure and namespace organization
9. **📖 Documentation Guidelines** - XML documentation standards
10. **⚡ Common Anti-Patterns to Avoid** - What NOT to do in .NET code
11. **🔗 Official Microsoft Resources** - Direct links to official documentation

This reference page follows the same format and style as your existing `quick-reference.md`, with:
- Clear tables and examples
- Emoji section headers for easy navigation
- ✅/❌ indicators for do's and don'ts
- Practical code examples
- Comprehensive resource links

The page serves as a quick reference for students to follow Microsoft's official guidelines when building .NET libraries and applications, complementing the existing curriculum content perfectly.

_**User**_

update the main readme to guide users to the quick reference, progress tracker, and design guidelines

---

_**Assistant**_



---

I'll help you update the main README to guide users to the key reference documents. Let me first read the current README to understand its structure.

---

Read file: curriculum/README.md

---

Now let me read the rest of the README to see the complete structure:

---

Read file: curriculum/README.md

---

Perfect! Now I can see the complete structure. I need to update the README to better highlight the three key reference documents (quick reference, progress tracker, and design guidelines) and make them more prominent. Let me update the "Quick Access" section and potentially add a dedicated section for these resources.

---



---

Perfect! I've successfully updated the main README to prominently feature the three essential reference documents. Here's what I added:

## Key Improvements Made:

1. **📚 Essential Reference Guides Section** - Created a dedicated, prominent section for the three key reference documents

2. **Detailed Descriptions** - Each reference document now has:
   - Clear purpose and audience
   - Detailed bullet points explaining what's covered
   - Strong action-oriented headers ("Keep this open while coding!", "Track your learning journey", "Build professional-quality code")

3. **Quick Navigation** - Added a practical navigation guide that directs users to the right document based on their current need:
   - New to .NET → Quick Reference Guide
   - Want to track progress → Progress Tracker  
   - Writing library code → Design Guidelines
   - Ready to start coding → Project 1

4. **Strategic Placement** - Positioned this section right before the final call-to-action, making it highly visible while maintaining the logical flow of the document

The update maintains the existing structure while significantly improving discoverability and usability of the three essential reference documents. Users will now have clear guidance on which resource to use when, and understand the value each document provides to their learning journey.

_**User**_

the curriculum should have a glossary of terms too

---

_**Assistant**_



---

You're absolutely right! A glossary would be a perfect addition to complete the reference documentation set. Let me create a comprehensive .NET glossary that complements the existing reference materials.

---



---

Let me create the file using the terminal first, then add the content:

---

```bash
cd curriculum && type nul > dotnet-glossary.md
```

```
C:\dev\MoshpitGames\dotnet-bytesize\curriculum>cd curriculum && type nul > dotnet-glossary.md
C:\dev\MoshpitGames\dotnet-bytesize\curriculum>
```

---

Now let me add the content to the glossary file:

---



---

Let me try a different approach since the file is empty:

---



---

Let me try a simpler approach and write directly to the file using a command:

---

```bash
cd curriculum && echo # .NET Glossary > dotnet-glossary.md
```

```
C:\dev\MoshpitGames\dotnet-bytesize\curriculum>cd curriculum && echo # .NET Glossary > dotnet-glossary.md
The system cannot find the path specified.

C:\dev\MoshpitGames\dotnet-bytesize\curriculum>
```

---

```bash
cd curriculum && echo # .NET Glossary > dotnet-glossary.md
```

```
C:\dev\MoshpitGames\dotnet-bytesize\curriculum>cd curriculum && echo # .NET Glossary > dotnet-glossary.md
The system cannot find the path specified.

C:\dev\MoshpitGames\dotnet-bytesize\curriculum>
```

---

Let me check the current directory and then create the file:

---

```bash
dir
```

```

Let me check what's in project 5 (statistics analyzer) which seems to cover LINQ and functional concepts:

---

Read file: curriculum/project-05-statistics-analyzer/README.md

---

Now let me check what specific functional programming concepts need enhancement. Based on my analysis, I can see several gaps and opportunities for improvement:

---



---

Now let me add a dedicated functional programming section to the quick reference:

---



---

Now let me enhance the glossary to include more functional programming terms:

---



---



---



---



---



---

Now let me update the documentation links in the quick reference to include functional programming resources:

---



---

Now let me check Project 3 (String Utilities) to see if it adequately covers functional programming concepts since it deals with extension methods:

---

Good! Project 3 does include some functional concepts. Now let me enhance the curriculum to ensure Project 5 has better coverage of functional programming concepts. Let me add a specific section about functional programming patterns to the Project 5:

---



---

Perfect! I've successfully enhanced the curriculum to ensure comprehensive coverage of lambdas, predicates, selectors, callbacks, and related functional programming concepts. Here's a summary of the improvements made:

## ✅ Enhanced Functional Programming Coverage

### 📖 Quick Reference Guide Improvements
- **Enhanced LINQ section** with predicate and selector examples
- **Added dedicated Functional Programming section** covering:
  - Lambda expressions and anonymous functions
  - Method groups and delegate conversion
  - Higher-order functions
  - Callbacks and event handlers
  - Functional composition and closures
  - Partial application patterns
  - Built-in delegate types (`Action`, `Func`, `Predicate`)
  - Event-driven programming patterns

### 📚 Glossary Enhancements
Added comprehensive definitions for:
- **Callback** - Functions passed as arguments
- **Closure** - Lambda expressions capturing outer variables
- **Higher-Order Function** - Functions that operate on other functions
- **Method Group** - Method references convertible to delegates
- **Partial Application** - Fixing function arguments
- **Predicate** - Boolean-returning functions for filtering
- **Selector** - Projection functions for data transformation

### 🔗 Documentation Links
- Added **Functional Programming section** to documentation links
- Included links to `Func<T>`, `Action<T>`, `Predicate<T>` documentation
- Added method groups and expression trees references

### 🎯 Project Coverage Analysis

**Current Strong Coverage:**
- **Project 3** - Extension methods with `Action<T>` and `Func<T>` examples
- **Project 5** - LINQ with extensive predicate/selector usage, enhanced functional programming documentation

**Curriculum Structure Benefits:**
1. **Progressive Learning** - Concepts build from simple extension methods to complex LINQ operations
2. **Practical Application** - All functional concepts demonstrated in real game development contexts
3. **Modern Patterns** - Covers both traditional delegates and modern lambda expressions
4. **Performance Awareness** - Includes guidance on when to use different approaches

The curriculum now comprehensively covers:
- ✅ **Lambdas** - Anonymous functions and closures
- ✅ **Predicates** - Boolean functions for filtering (`Where`, `Any`, `All`)
- ✅ **Selectors** - Projection functions (`Select`, `SelectMany`)
- ✅ **Callbacks** - Functions passed as parameters, event handlers
- ✅ **Method Groups** - Converting existing methods to delegates
- ✅ **Higher-Order Functions** - Functions that operate on other functions
- ✅ **Functional Composition** - Combining functions
- ✅ **Built-in Delegates** - `Action<T>`, `Func<T>`, `Predicate<T>`

Students will encounter these concepts progressively through hands-on projects, with comprehensive reference materials and Microsoft documentation links to deepen their understanding! 🎯

Now I'll add the records and primary constructor documentation:

---



---

Perfect! I've successfully enhanced the curriculum to ensure comprehensive coverage of records and primary constructors. Here's a summary of what I've added:

## 📦 Records & Primary Constructors Coverage Added

### **Quick Reference Guide Enhancements:**
- **Dedicated section** on Records & Primary Constructors with practical examples
- **Type decision matrix** including when to use `record` vs `class` vs `struct`
- **Complete record feature showcase**:
  - Basic positional records
  - Record classes vs record structs
  - Custom members in records
  - Record inheritance and pattern matching
  - Primary constructors for classes and structs
  - Advanced patterns with nested records

### **Glossary Additions:**
- **Primary Constructor** definition in P section
- **Record** definition in R section with version information

### **Project 5 (Statistics Analyzer) Enhancements:**
- **Enhanced record examples** with real-world game development context
- **Record inheritance hierarchy** for game events
- **Pattern matching** with records in switch expressions
- **Record deconstruction** in LINQ operations
- **Immutable updates** with `with` expressions
- **Value-based equality** demonstrations
- **Custom methods** and properties in records
- **Documentation links** for modern C# features

### **Key Features Now Covered:**

✅ **Records (C# 9+)**:
- Positional parameters and automatic properties
- Value-based equality and ToString()
- Immutable updates with `with` expressions
- Record inheritance and polymorphism
- Deconstruction patterns
- Custom members and methods

✅ **Primary Constructors (C# 12+)**:
- Class primary constructors with dependency injection
- Struct primary constructors for value types
- Parameter availability throughout the type
- Integration with validation patterns

✅ **Advanced Patterns**:
- Pattern matching with record types
- Record inheritance hierarchies
- Integration with LINQ and functional programming
- Performance considerations and best practices

The curriculum now provides comprehensive, practical coverage of both records and primary constructors through game development examples, ensuring students understand not just the syntax but also when and why to use these modern C# features! 🎯

_**User**_

can we rename all the README.md files so that theyre named more descriptively?

---

_**Assistant**_



---

Absolutely! Having more descriptive names will make the project guides easier to identify. Let me first check what files we currently have and then rename them to be more descriptive.

---

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory curriculum • **10** results</summary>
        
| Name |
|-------|
| 📄 `dotnet-glossary.md` |
| 📄 `quick-reference.md` |
| 📄 `README.md` |
| 📄 `progress-tracker.md` |
| 📄 `dotnet-design-guidelines.md` |
| 📁 `project-05-statistics-analyzer` |
| 📁 `project-04-state-machine` |
| 📁 `project-03-string-utilities` |
| 📁 `project-02-card-deck` |
| 📁 `project-01-dice-roller` |

</details>

---

Now let me check each project directory to see their current README.md files:

---

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory curriculum/project-01-dice-roller • **1** results</summary>
        
| Name |
|-------|
| 📄 `README.md` |

</details>

---

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory curriculum/project-02-card-deck • **1** results</summary>

</details>

---

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory curriculum/project-03-string-utilities • **1** results</summary>

</details>

---

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory curriculum/project-04-state-machine • **1** results</summary>

</details>

---

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory curriculum/project-05-statistics-analyzer • **1** results</summary>
        
| Name |
|-------|
| 📄 `README.md` |

</details>

---

Perfect! Now I'll rename all the project README.md files to be more descriptive. I'll use the `mv` command to rename them:

---

```bash
cd curriculum/project-01-dice-roller && move README.md dice-roller-project-guide.md
```

```
C:\dev\MoshpitGames\dotnet-bytesize\curriculum>cd curriculum/project-01-dice-roller && move README.md dice-roller-project-guid
e.md
The system cannot find the path specified.

C:\dev\MoshpitGames\dotnet-bytesize\curriculum>
```

---

Let me fix the path and try again:

---

```bash
cd curriculum\project-01-dice-roller && move README.md dice-roller-project-guide.md
```

```
C:\dev\MoshpitGames\dotnet-bytesize\curriculum>cd curriculum\project-01-dice-roller && move README.md dice-roller-project-guid
e.md
The system cannot find the path specified.

C:\dev\MoshpitGames\dotnet-bytesize\curriculum>
```

---

Let me navigate to the correct directory first:

---

```bash
cd curriculum && dir
```

```
C:\dev\MoshpitGames\dotnet-bytesize\curriculum>cd curriculum && dir
The system cannot find the path specified.

C:\dev\MoshpitGames\dotnet-bytesize\curriculum>
```

---

I see I'm already in the wrong directory. Let me get back to the correct base directory:

---

```bash
cd ..
```

```
C:\dev\MoshpitGames\dotnet-bytesize\curriculum>cd ..

C:\dev\MoshpitGames\dotnet-bytesize>
```

---

Great! Now let me rename each project's README.md file:

---

```bash
move "curriculum\project-01-dice-roller\README.md" "curriculum\project-01-dice-roller\dice-roller-project-guide.md"
```

```
C:\dev\MoshpitGames\dotnet-bytesize>move "curriculum\project-01-dice-roller\README.md" "curriculum\project-01-dice-roller\dice
-roller-project-guide.md"
        1 file(s) moved.

C:\dev\MoshpitGames\dotnet-bytesize>
```

---

```bash
move "curriculum\project-02-card-deck\README.md" "curriculum\project-02-card-deck\card-deck-project-guide.md"
```

```
C:\dev\MoshpitGames\dotnet-bytesize>move "curriculum\project-02-card-deck\README.md" "curriculum\project-02-card-deck\card-dec
k-project-guide.md"
        1 file(s) moved.

C:\dev\MoshpitGames\dotnet-bytesize>
```

---

```bash
move "curriculum\project-03-string-utilities\README.md" "curriculum\project-03-string-utilities\string-utilities-project-guide.md"
```

```
C:\dev\MoshpitGames\dotnet-bytesize>move "curriculum\project-03-string-utilities\README.md" "curriculum\project-03-string-util
ities\string-utilities-project-guide.md"
        1 file(s) moved.
C:\dev\MoshpitGames\dotnet-bytesize>
```

---

```bash
move "curriculum\project-04-state-machine\README.md" "curriculum\project-04-state-machine\state-machine-project-guide.md"
```

```
C:\dev\MoshpitGames\dotnet-bytesize>move "curriculum\project-04-state-machine\README.md" "curriculum\project-04-state-machine\
state-machine-project-guide.md"
        1 file(s) moved.

C:\dev\MoshpitGames\dotnet-bytesize>
```

---

```bash
move "curriculum\project-05-statistics-analyzer\README.md" "curriculum\project-05-statistics-analyzer\statistics-analyzer-project-guide.md"
```

```
C:\dev\MoshpitGames\dotnet-bytesize>move "curriculum\project-05-statistics-analyzer\README.md" "curriculum\project-05-statisti
cs-analyze                          move "curriculum\project-05-statistics-analyzer\README.md" "curriculum\project-05-statisti
cs-analyzer\statistics-analyzer-project-guide.md"
        1 file(s) moved.

C:\dev\MoshpitGames\dotnet-bytesize>
```

---

Perfect! Now let me verify that all the files have been renamed correctly:

---

```bash
dir curriculum\project-*\*.md
```

```
C:\dev\MoshpitGames\dotnet-bytesize>dir curriculum\project-*\*.md
C:\dev\MoshpitGames\dotnet-bytesize>
```

---

Let me try a different approach to verify:

---

```bash
for /d %i in (curriculum\project-*) do @echo %i && dir "%i\*.md"
```

```
C:\dev\MoshpitGames\dotnet-bytesize>for /d %i in (curriculum\project-*) do @echo %i && dir "%i\*.md"

Excellent! All the project README.md files have been successfully renamed. Now I need to update the main curriculum README.md to reflect these new filenames. Let me read the current main README and update the links:

---

Read file: curriculum/README.md

---

I see that the README doesn't contain direct links to the individual project files. Let me search for where these links might be:

---

<details>
            <summary>Grep search for "project-0.*README" • **0** files</summary>
        
No results found
</details>

---

Let me check if there are any direct project links at all:

---

</details>

---

I found the issue! The README is still referencing the old directory name `week-01-dice-roller` instead of `project-01-dice-roller`, and it's pointing to the old `README.md` files. Let me update these links:

---



---



---

Now let me add a comprehensive project navigation section to the main README that links to all the newly renamed project guides:

---



---

Let me check the exact structure around that area:

---

Read file: curriculum/README.md

---

I'll add the project navigation section right after the Final Project Options section, before the Success Metrics:

---



---

Perfect! Let me also check if there are any other references that need updating in the progress tracker or other files. Let me search for any remaining references to the old README.md files:

The search shows that the old references are mostly in history files (which is fine) and the actual project files have been renamed. Let me verify that the current structure is correct by listing the final state:

---

```bash
dir curriculum\project-*
```

```
C:\dev\MoshpitGames\dotnet-bytesize>dir curriculum\project-*

Perfect! 🎉 I've successfully renamed all the README.md files to be more descriptive and updated all the necessary references. Here's a summary of what was accomplished:

## ✅ Successfully Renamed All Project Guides

### **Before → After:**
- `project-01-dice-roller/README.md` → **`dice-roller-project-guide.md`**
- `project-02-card-deck/README.md` → **`card-deck-project-guide.md`**
- `project-03-string-utilities/README.md` → **`string-utilities-project-guide.md`**
- `project-04-state-machine/README.md` → **`state-machine-project-guide.md`**
- `project-05-statistics-analyzer/README.md` → **`statistics-analyzer-project-guide.md`**

### **Updated References:**
1. **Main curriculum README.md** - Updated the two existing links to point to the new dice-roller-project-guide.md
2. **Added comprehensive Project Guides section** with direct links to all renamed project guides, organized by learning phase
3. **Fixed directory reference** from the old `week-01-dice-roller` to the correct `project-01-dice-roller`

### **Benefits of the New Naming:**
- **🔍 Easier to identify** - File names clearly indicate what each project covers
- **📁 Better organization** - Descriptive names make file management simpler
- **🔗 Clearer navigation** - Links in the main README are now self-documenting
- **🎯 Improved discoverability** - Users can quickly find the specific project they need

The curriculum now has a much cleaner structure with descriptive filenames that make it immediately clear what each project guide covers, while maintaining all the comprehensive content about records, primary constructors, and other modern C# features we added earlier! 📚

I think the curriculum subdirectory is redundant, can we move its contents up a level?
