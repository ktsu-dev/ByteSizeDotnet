</details>

Now let me check the testing guidelines section specifically to see what framework is currently mentioned:

---

Read file: microsoft-design-guidelines.md

---

Now let me check the curriculum details to see what testing framework is currently mentioned in Project 18:

---

Read file: curriculum-details.md

---

I can see that Project 18 currently mentions "xUnit, NUnit, Moq" as the testing frameworks. Let me also check the progress tracker to see what testing strategies are mentioned there:

---

Read file: progress-tracker.md

---

Now I understand the current state. The curriculum currently mentions "xUnit, NUnit" as testing frameworks in Project 18, but you want to standardize on MSTest. Let me update the relevant documents to reflect this preference for MSTest framework.

---



---



---

Now let me update the microsoft-design-guidelines.md file to include MSTest-specific testing guidance:

---



---

Now let me check if there's a testing patterns section in the reference files and update that as well:

---

Read file: reference/quick-syntax.md

---

I need to update the testing patterns section to use MSTest instead of xUnit. Let me make that change:

---



---

Now let me create a note to save this preference as a workspace rule that can be fetched in the future:

### Rule: derived-cursor-rules

**AI rules derived by SpecStory from the project AI interaction history**

```markdown
## HEADERS

## TECH STACK

## PROJECT DOCUMENTATION & CONTEXT SYSTEM

*   The curriculum should contain a dedicated page similar to the quick reference for the Microsoft design and style guidelines for .NET libraries and applications.
*   The curriculum should have a glossary of terms too.
*   Update the main README to guide users to the quick reference, progress tracker, and design guidelines.

## CODING STANDARDS

## WORKFLOW & RELEASE RULES

## DEBUGGING

## BEST PRACTICES & GUIDELINES

When creating .NET learning curricula, prioritize the following:

*   **Focus:** Emphasize building libraries, tools, and games over web services.
*   **Time Commitment:** Design projects suitable for approximately 2 hours of evening work.
*   **ADHD Considerations:** Create small, approachable projects with a clear, single focus to facilitate learning and maintain engagement.
*   **Programming Fundamentals:** Minimize time spent on basic programming constructs (conditions, flow control, variables, types, methods). Instead, focus on their .NET-specific expressions and nomenclature.
*   **Advanced Concepts:** Prioritize topics like:
    *   Containers
    *   Async programming
    *   Extension methods
    *   Pattern matching
    *   Enumerables and deferred execution
    *   LINQ
    *   Fluent APIs
    *   Dependency Injection
    *   NuGet
    *   Reflection
    *   SOLID and DRY principles
    *   Lambdas
    *   Predicates
    *   Selectors
    *   Callbacks
*   **Curriculum Structure:** Structure concepts to build upon each other logically. Projects do not need to be related to each other thematically; unrelated projects may be preferable to minimize contextual distractions.

*   **Stack vs Heap Allocation:** When explaining value vs. reference semantics in the quick reference, always explain stack vs heap allocation *before* explaining value vs reference semantics. This provides necessary context.

*   **Terminology Reference Table:** The quick reference guide should include a table relating common .NET names (class, struct, method, parameter, property, field) to generic programming terms and their counterparts in other languages (e.g., Java, Python, JavaScript, C++, Go, Rust). This table should cover core types, code organization, modifiers, and advanced features and modern patterns. It should also include a section explaining key differences, such as properties being unique to .NET, struct differences between .NET and C++ struct differences between .NET and C++, namespace vs. package concepts, event system specifics, and LINQ as a unique .NET feature. Position the table after the naming conventions section in the quick reference. The language translation guide should mention records, containers, lambdas objects, built in types, tuples etc.

*   **Documentation Links:** The quick reference should provide quick links to Microsoft documentation for each topic. **The documents should always provide quick links to the Microsoft documentation. Reading the docs should be a fundamental theme of the curriculum.** Documentation links should be added throughout the curriculum, including in the main curriculum README and individual project READMEs, organized into logical categories. This reinforces documentation reading as a core skill.

*   The curriculum should contain a dedicated page similar to the quick reference for the Microsoft design and style guidelines for .NET libraries and applications.

*   Ensure the curriculum covers lambdas, predicates, selectors, callbacks, records, primary constructors, and other relevant modern .NET features.

*   **Document Structure & Layout:** The project should adhere to the following document structure:

    *   **README.md:** Streamlined high-level curriculum overview, learning philosophy, quick navigation to other documents, and a "Getting started" section (approximately 200 lines).
    *   **curriculum-details.md:** Detailed project information, phase-by-phase breakdown, learning objectives, and deliverables (approximately 400 lines).
    *   **microsoft-design-guidelines.md:** Keep as standalone file with current comprehensive content (approximately 700 lines). Add curriculum cross-references (which projects use which guidelines) and maybe add a "Quick Start" section at the top for immediate needs.
    *   **language-essentials.md:** Core .NET concepts needed for the curriculum, essential syntax and patterns, and cross-references to full reference docs (approximately 300 lines). Heavy cross-references to Microsoft guidelines. "See design-guidelines.md for the full story" type callouts.
    *   **reference/:** A directory containing focused reference files:
        *   **reference/glossary.md:** Term definitions (approximately 300 lines - current size).
        *   **reference/language-comparison.md:** Language mappings from the quick-reference (approximately 400 lines).
        *   **reference/quick-syntax.md:** Syntax examples (approximately 300 lines).
    *   **progress-tracker.md:** Current progress tracking (approximately 300 lines). Add "Guidelines Checklist" for each project and links to specific guideline sections.

    This structure promotes shorter, focused documents with a clear purpose for each file, progressive disclosure of information, and easy maintenance.

    When restructuring documents, consider these principles:
    *   **Minimize Redundancy:** Remove duplicate content, especially between naming conventions in multiple files.
    *   **Establish Clear Hierarchies:** Present basic concepts before advanced topics.
    *   **Incorporate Cross-References:** Link related concepts to improve understanding.
    *   **Separate Concerns:** Distinguish between reference material and curriculum content.
    *   **Maintain Consistent Formatting:** Ensure uniform formatting across all documents.
    *   **Utilize Headers Effectively:** Employ headers for clear navigation.
    *   **Include Tables of Contents:** Add tables of contents to longer documents.
    *   **Use Visual Indicators:** Use icons or formatting to differentiate content types.
    *   **Provide Quick Navigation:** Include a quick navigation section in the README.
    *   **Differentiate "What You Need" vs "Reference":** Clearly distinguish between essential information and reference material.
    *   **Optimize for Search:** Use search-friendly headings and keywords.
    *   **Employ Progressive Disclosure:** Present summaries first, with details available upon request.

*   **README Content:** The README must have the following:
    *   High-level curriculum overview
    *   A prominent "Essential Resources" section highlighting Microsoft guidelines
    *   Quick navigation with clear callouts to design guidelines
    *   A "Getting started" workflow that references guidelines early

The "Essential Resources" section should be formatted as follows:

```markdown

Use the [Progress Tracker](progress-tracker.md) to monitor your advancement and reflect on learnings.

### 4. **Reference as Needed** 📖
Bookmark the [Reference Directory](reference/) for quick lookups during development.
```

The README should also have a "Final Projects" section, with the following content:

```markdown
## Final Projects (Choose One)

After completing the 20 core projects, choose a capstone project:

- **Game Engine Architecture** - Combine multiple patterns into a cohesive game engine
- **Development Toolchain** - Build a complete development workflow with CI/CD
- **Performance-Critical Library** - Create a highly optimized library using advanced .NET features
```

The README should also have a "Project Structure" section, with the following content:

```markdown
Each project folder contains:
- **README.md** - Project overview and requirements
- **src/** - Implementation code
- **tests/** - Unit tests (when applicable)
- **docs/** - Project-specific documentation
```

The README should also have a "Contributing" section, with the following content:

```markdown
## Contributing

This curriculum is open for contributions! See individual project folders for specific contribution guidelines.
```

The README should also have a "Learning Support" section, with the following content:

```markdown
## Learning Support

- **Microsoft Guidelines Integration** - Each project explicitly references relevant design guidelines
- **Cross-References** - Documents link to related concepts across the curriculum
- **Progressive Disclosure** - Start simple, reference deeper material as needed
- **Practical Focus** - Every concept is taught through building real libraries and tools
```

*   **Unit Testing Framework:** When teaching unit testing, use the MSTest framework.```

Perfect! I can see that the workspace rules already exist and I need to add the MSTest preference. Let me update the derived cursor rules to include this:

---

```diff
- 
+ ## HEADERS
+ 
+ ## TECH STACK
+ 
+ ## PROJECT DOCUMENTATION & CONTEXT SYSTEM
+ 
+ *   The curriculum should contain a dedicated page similar to the quick reference for the Microsoft design and style guidelines for .NET libraries and applications.
+ *   The curriculum should have a glossary of terms too.
+ *   Update the main README to guide users to the quick reference, progress tracker, and design guidelines.
+ 
+ ## CODING STANDARDS
+ 
+ ## WORKFLOW & RELEASE RULES
+ 
+ ## DEBUGGING
+ 
+ ## BEST PRACTICES & GUIDELINES
+ 
+ When creating .NET learning curricula, prioritize the following:
+ 
+ *   **Focus:** Emphasize building libraries, tools, and games over web services.
+ *   **Time Commitment:** Design projects suitable for approximately 2 hours of evening work.
+ *   **ADHD Considerations:** Create small, approachable projects with a clear, single focus to facilitate learning and maintain engagement.
+ *   **Programming Fundamentals:** Minimize time spent on basic programming constructs (conditions, flow control, variables, types, methods). Instead, focus on their .NET-specific expressions and nomenclature.
+ *   **Advanced Concepts:** Prioritize topics like:
+     *   Containers
+     *   Async programming
+     *   Extension methods
+     *   Pattern matching
+     *   Enumerables and deferred execution
+     *   LINQ
+     *   Fluent APIs
+     *   Dependency Injection
+     *   NuGet
+     *   Reflection
+     *   SOLID and DRY principles
+     *   Lambdas
+     *   Predicates
+     *   Selectors
+     *   Callbacks
+ *   **Curriculum Structure:** Structure concepts to build upon each other logically. Projects do not need to be related to each other thematically; unrelated projects may be preferable to minimize contextual distractions.
+ 
+ *   **Stack vs Heap Allocation:** When explaining value vs. reference semantics in the quick reference, always explain stack vs heap allocation *before* explaining value vs reference semantics. This provides necessary context.
+ 
+ *   **Terminology Reference Table:** The quick reference guide should include a table relating common .NET names (class, struct, method, parameter, property, field) to generic programming terms and their counterparts in other languages (e.g., Java, Python, JavaScript, C++, Go, Rust). This table should cover core types, code organization, modifiers, and advanced features and modern patterns. It should also include a section explaining key differences, such as properties being unique to .NET, struct differences between .NET and C++ struct differences between .NET and C++, namespace vs. package concepts, event system specifics, and LINQ as a unique .NET feature. Position the table after the naming conventions section in the quick reference. The language translation guide should mention records, containers, lambdas objects, built in types, tuples etc.
+ 
+ *   **Documentation Links:** The quick reference should provide quick links to Microsoft documentation for each topic. **The documents should always provide quick links to the Microsoft documentation. Reading the docs should be a fundamental theme of the curriculum.** Documentation links should be added throughout the curriculum, including in the main curriculum README and individual project READMEs, organized into logical categories. This reinforces documentation reading as a core skill.
+ 
+ *   The curriculum should contain a dedicated page similar to the quick reference for the Microsoft design and style guidelines for .NET libraries and applications.
+ 
+ *   Ensure the curriculum covers lambdas, predicates, selectors, callbacks, records, primary constructors, and other relevant modern .NET features.
+ 
+ *   **Document Structure & Layout:** The project should adhere to the following document structure:
+ 
+     *   **README.md:** Streamlined high-level curriculum overview, learning philosophy, quick navigation to other documents, and a "Getting started" section (approximately 200 lines).
+     *   **curriculum-details.md:** Detailed project information, phase-by-phase breakdown, learning objectives, and deliverables (approximately 400 lines).
+     *   **microsoft-design-guidelines.md:** Keep as standalone file with current comprehensive content (approximately 700 lines). Add curriculum cross-references (which projects use which guidelines) and maybe add a "Quick Start" section at the top for immediate needs.
+     *   **language-essentials.md:** Core .NET concepts needed for the curriculum, essential syntax and patterns, and cross-references to full reference docs (approximately 300 lines). Heavy cross-references to Microsoft guidelines. "See design-guidelines.md for the full story" type callouts.
+     *   **reference/:** A directory containing focused reference files:
+         *   **reference/glossary.md:** Term definitions (approximately 300 lines - current size).
+         *   **reference/language-comparison.md:** Language mappings from the quick-reference (approximately 400 lines).
+         *   **reference/quick-syntax.md:** Syntax examples (approximately 300 lines).
+     *   **progress-tracker.md:** Current progress tracking (approximately 300 lines). Add "Guidelines Checklist" for each project and links to specific guideline sections.
+ 
+     This structure promotes shorter, focused documents with a clear purpose for each file, progressive disclosure of information, and easy maintenance.
+ 
+     When restructuring documents, consider these principles:
+     *   **Minimize Redundancy:** Remove duplicate content, especially between naming conventions in multiple files.
+     *   **Establish Clear Hierarchies:** Present basic concepts before advanced topics.
+     *   **Incorporate Cross-References:** Link related concepts to improve understanding.
+     *   **Separate Concerns:** Distinguish between reference material and curriculum content.
+     *   **Maintain Consistent Formatting:** Ensure uniform formatting across all documents.
+     *   **Utilize Headers Effectively:** Employ headers for clear navigation.
+     *   **Include Tables of Contents:** Add tables of contents to longer documents.
+     *   **Use Visual Indicators:** Use icons or formatting to differentiate content types.
+     *   **Provide Quick Navigation:** Include a quick navigation section in the README.
+     *   **Differentiate "What You Need" vs "Reference":** Clearly distinguish between essential information and reference material.
+     *   **Optimize for Search:** Use search-friendly headings and keywords.
+     *   **Employ Progressive Disclosure:** Present summaries first, with details available upon request.
+ 
+ *   **README Content:** The README must have the following:
+     *   High-level curriculum overview
+     *   A prominent "Essential Resources" section highlighting Microsoft guidelines
+     *   Quick navigation with clear callouts to design guidelines
+     *   A "Getting started" workflow that references guidelines early
+ 
+ The "Essential Resources" section should be formatted as follows:
+ 
+ ```markdown
+ ## Essential Resources Before You Start

Perfect! I've successfully updated your .NET curriculum to standardize on the MSTest framework for unit testing. Here's a summary of the changes I made:

## Changes Made:

### 1. **Updated Project 18 Description**
- Changed from "xUnit, NUnit, Moq" to "MSTest, Moq, test organization, test attributes"
- Updated both `curriculum-details.md` and `progress-tracker.md`

### 2. **Updated Microsoft Design Guidelines**
- Added MSTest framework documentation link to the Testing Guidelines section

### 3. **Updated Testing Examples**
- Modified the testing patterns in `reference/quick-syntax.md` to use MSTest attributes:
  - `[TestMethod]` instead of `[Fact]`
  - Added `[DataRow]` attributes for parameterized tests
  - Used MSTest assertion methods like `Assert.IsTrue()`

### 4. **Updated Workspace Rules**
- Added MSTest preference to the derived cursor rules so future interactions will remember this preference

## Key MSTest Features Now Emphasized:

- **`[TestMethod]`** - Basic test method attribute
- **`[DataRow]`** - For parameterized tests with multiple test cases
- **MSTest assertions** - Using `Assert.IsTrue()`, `Assert.AreEqual()`, etc.
- **Test organization** - Proper test structure and naming conventions

The curriculum now consistently uses MSTest throughout all documentation and examples, ensuring students learn this specific testing framework rather than having to choose between multiple options. This standardization will provide a more focused learning experience and align with Microsoft's own testing tools and practices.
