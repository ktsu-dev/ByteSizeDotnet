# Escape angle brackets in markdown headings (2025-06-08 16:33:56)

_**User**_

in the markdown files, we need to escape angle brackets in headings:

## This<T>

shoud be

## This\<T\>

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you escape angle brackets in headings across all markdown files. Let me first search for markdown files with headings that contain angle brackets.

---

<details>
            <summary>Grep search for "^#+.*<.*>.*" • **1** files</summary>
        
| File | Line | Match |
|------|------|-------|
| `file:///c%3A/dev/MoshpitGames/dotnet-bytesize/reference/language-comparison.md` | L192 | `### Span\<T\>` |

</details>

---

<details>
            <summary>Grep search for "^#+.*<[^\\]" • **1** files</summary>
        
| File | Line | Match |
|------|------|-------|
| `file:///c%3A/dev/MoshpitGames/dotnet-bytesize/reference/language-comparison.md` | L192 | `### Span\<T\>` |

</details>

---

Let me search more broadly for any angle brackets in markdown files to make sure I catch all instances:

---

<details>
            <summary>Grep search for "^#+.*<" • **2** files</summary>
        
| File | Line | Match |
|------|------|-------|
| `file:///c%3A/dev/MoshpitGames/dotnet-bytesize/reference/language-comparison.md` | L192 | `### Span\<T\>` |
| `file:///c%3A/dev/MoshpitGames/dotnet-bytesize/.specstory/history/2025-06-08_06-33-untitled.md` | L8 | `## This<T>` |
| `file:///c%3A/dev/MoshpitGames/dotnet-bytesize/.specstory/history/2025-06-08_06-33-untitled.md` | L12 | `## This\<T\>` |

</details>

Great! I found instances in two files. Let me check both files to see what needs to be fixed:

---

Read file: reference/language-comparison.md

---

I can see that the `Span<T>` in line 192 is actually already escaped properly. Let me check the other file:

---

Read file: .specstory/history/2025-06-08_06-33-untitled.md

---

It appears this file is just a SpecStory history file with the example from your question. Let me search more broadly to ensure I find any other unescaped angle brackets in headings across all markdown files:

---

<details>
            <summary>Grep search for "^#+[^\\]*<[^\\]" • **1** files</summary>
        
| File | Line | Match |
|------|------|-------|
| `file:///c%3A/dev/MoshpitGames/dotnet-bytesize/.specstory/history/2025-06-08_06-33-untitled.md` | L8 | `## This<T>` |

</details>

---

Let me also search for all the main markdown files in the repository to see if there are any other angle brackets to escape:

---

<details>
            <summary>Searched codebase "*.md" • **10** results</summary>
        
| File |
|------|
| `undefined` |
| `undefined` |
| `undefined` |
| `undefined` |
| `undefined` |
| `undefined` |
| `undefined` |
| `undefined` |
| `undefined` |
| `undefined` |

</details>

---

Let me search all markdown files for headings with angle brackets more systematically:

---

<details>
            <summary>Grep search for "^#+.*<" • **2** files</summary>
        
| File | Line | Match |
|------|------|-------|
| `file:///c%3A/dev/MoshpitGames/dotnet-bytesize/reference/language-comparison.md` | L192 | `### Span\<T\>` |
| `file:///c%3A/dev/MoshpitGames/dotnet-bytesize/.specstory/history/2025-06-08_06-33-untitled.md` | L8 | `## This<T>` |
| `file:///c%3A/dev/MoshpitGames/dotnet-bytesize/.specstory/history/2025-06-08_06-33-untitled.md` | L12 | `## This\<T\>` |

</details>

---

Let me search for specific generic type patterns that might need escaping in the main content files:

---

<details>
            <summary>Grep search for "^#+.*<T>" • **0** files</summary>
        
No results found
</details>

---

<details>
            <summary>Grep search for "^#+.*<.*>[^\\]" • **0** files</summary>
        
No results found
</details>

---

Let me check a few of the main markdown files to see if there are any generic types in headings that might need escaping:

---

Read file: language-essentials.md

---

<details>
            <summary>Grep search for "^#+.*<" • **0** files</summary>
        
No results found
</details>

---

Let me check if there are any other references to generic types in headings that might need to be escaped:

---

<details>
            <summary>Grep search for "^#+.*List<|^#+.*Dictionary<|^#+.*IEnumerable<|^#+.*Task<" • **0** files</summary>
        
No results found
</details>

---

Based on my comprehensive search, I found that:

1. In `reference/language-comparison.md`, line 192 has `### Span\<T\>` which is already correctly escaped
2. The only unescaped instance is in `.specstory/history/2025-06-08_06-33-untitled.md` on line 8: `## This<T>`

Since the SpecStory history file contains your example and isn't part of the main documentation, I believe the main markdown files are already properly formatted. However, let me fix that history file to be consistent:

---



---

Actually, let me reconsider. The `.specstory/history/` file appears to be an automatically generated history file that contains your example question. Let me double-check if there are any actual documentation files that need fixing by searching in the main directories:

---

<details>
            <summary>Grep search for "^#+.*<[^\\]" • **1** files</summary>
        
| File | Line | Match |
|------|------|-------|
| `file:///c%3A/dev/MoshpitGames/dotnet-bytesize/reference/language-comparison.md` | L192 | `### Span\<T\>` |

</details>

---

Wait, let me be more precise with the regex to exclude already escaped brackets:

---

<details>
            <summary>Grep search for "^#+[^<\\]*<[^\\]" • **0** files</summary>
        
No results found
</details>

---

Perfect! Based on my comprehensive search, I can confirm that:

✅ **All markdown files in your main documentation are already properly formatted**

The search shows that:
- `reference/language-comparison.md` line 192 has `### Span\<T\>` - already correctly escaped
- The only unescaped instance `## This<T>` is in `.specstory/history/2025-06-08_06-33-untitled.md`, which is an automatically generated history file containing your example question

**Summary:** Your markdown files already have properly escaped angle brackets in headings. The `Span\<T\>` heading in the reference documentation is correctly formatted as `Span\<T\>`, and no other headings with generic types were found that need escaping.
