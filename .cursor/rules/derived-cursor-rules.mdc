## HEADERS

## TECH STACK

## PROJECT DOCUMENTATION & CONTEXT SYSTEM

*   The curriculum should contain a dedicated page similar to the quick reference for the Microsoft design and style guidelines for .NET libraries and applications.
*   The curriculum should have a glossary of terms too.
*   Update the main README to guide users to the quick reference, progress tracker, and design guidelines.

## CODING STANDARDS

*   Ensure all csproj files, especially in test projects, have uniform settings.
*   **Markdown Headings:** Angle brackets in markdown headings must be escaped. For example: `## This<T>` should be `## This\<T\>`.

## WORKFLOW & RELEASE RULES

## DEBUGGING

## BEST PRACTICES & GUIDELINES

When creating .NET learning curricula, prioritize the following:

*   **Focus:** Emphasize building libraries, tools, and games over web services.
*   **Time Commitment:** Design projects suitable for approximately 2 hours of evening work.
*   **ADHD Considerations:** Create small, approachable projects with a clear, single focus to facilitate learning and maintain engagement.
*   **Programming Fundamentals:** Minimize time spent on basic programming constructs (conditions, flow control, variables, types, methods). Instead, focus on their .NET-specific expressions and nomenclature.
*   **Advanced Concepts:** Prioritize topics like:
    *   Containers
    *   Async programming
    *   Extension methods
    *   Pattern matching
    *   Enumerables and deferred execution
    *   LINQ
    *   Fluent APIs
    *   Dependency Injection
    *   NuGet
    *   Reflection
    *   SOLID and DRY principles
    *   Lambdas
    *   Predicates
    *   Selectors
    *   Callbacks
*   **Curriculum Structure:** Structure concepts to build upon each other logically. Projects do not need to be related to each other thematically; unrelated projects may be preferable to minimize contextual distractions.

*   **Stack vs Heap Allocation:** When explaining value vs. reference semantics in the quick reference, always explain stack vs heap allocation *before* explaining value vs reference semantics. This provides necessary context.

*   **Terminology Reference Table:** The quick reference guide should include a table relating common .NET names (class, struct, method, parameter, property, field) to generic programming terms and their counterparts in other languages (e.g., Java, Python, JavaScript, C++, Go, Rust). This table should cover core types, code organization, modifiers, and advanced features and modern patterns. It should also include a section explaining key differences, such as properties being unique to .NET, struct differences between .NET and C++ struct differences between .NET and C++, namespace vs. package concepts, event system specifics, and LINQ as a unique .NET feature. Position the table after the naming conventions section in the quick reference. The language translation guide should mention records, containers, lambdas objects, built in types, tuples etc.

*   **Documentation Links:** The quick reference should provide quick links to Microsoft documentation for each topic. **The documents should always provide quick links to the Microsoft documentation. Reading the docs should be a fundamental theme of the curriculum.** Documentation links should be added throughout the curriculum, including in the main curriculum README and individual project READMEs, organized into logical categories. This reinforces documentation reading as a core skill.

*   The curriculum should contain a dedicated page similar to the quick reference for the Microsoft design and style guidelines for .NET libraries and applications.

*   Ensure the curriculum covers lambdas, predicates, selectors, callbacks, records, primary constructors, and other relevant modern .NET features.

*   **Document Structure & Layout:** The project should adhere to the following document structure:

    *   **README.md:** Streamlined high-level curriculum overview, learning philosophy, quick navigation to other documents, and a "Getting started" section (approximately 200 lines). **The README is now the full implementation guide after merging the project guide content.**
    *   **curriculum-details.md:** Detailed project information, phase-by-phase breakdown, learning objectives, and deliverables (approximately 400 lines).
    *   **microsoft-design-guidelines.md:** Keep as standalone file with current comprehensive content (approximately 700 lines). Add curriculum cross-references (which projects use which guidelines) and maybe add a "Quick Start" section at the top for immediate needs.
    *   **language-essentials.md:** Core .NET concepts needed for the curriculum, essential syntax and patterns, and cross-references to full reference docs (approximately 300 lines). Heavy cross-references to Microsoft guidelines. "See design-guidelines.md for the full story" type callouts.
    *   **reference/:** A directory containing focused reference files:
        *   **reference/glossary.md:** Term definitions (approximately 300 lines - current size).
        *   **reference/language-comparison.md:** Language mappings from the quick-reference (approximately 400 lines).
        *   **reference/quick-syntax.md:** Syntax examples (approximately 300 lines).
    *   **progress-tracker.md:** Current progress tracking (approximately 300 lines). Add "Guidelines Checklist" for each project and links to specific guideline sections.

    This structure promotes shorter, focused documents with a clear purpose for each file, progressive disclosure of information, and easy maintenance.

    When restructuring documents, consider these principles:
    *   **Minimize Redundancy:** Remove duplicate content, especially between naming conventions in multiple files.
    *   **Establish Clear Hierarchies:** Present basic concepts before advanced topics.
    *   **Incorporate Cross-References:** Link related concepts to improve understanding.
    *   **Separate Concerns:** Distinguish between reference material and curriculum content.
    *   **Maintain Consistent Formatting:** Ensure uniform formatting across all documents.
    *   **Utilize Headers Effectively:** Employ headers for clear navigation.
    *   **Include Tables of Contents:** Add tables of contents to longer documents.
    *   **Use Visual Indicators:** Use icons or formatting to differentiate content types.
    *   **Provide Quick Navigation:** Include a quick navigation section in the README.
    *   **Differentiate "What You Need" vs "Reference":** Clearly distinguish between essential information and reference material.
    *   **Optimize for Search:** Use search-friendly headings and keywords.
    *   **Employ Progressive Disclosure:** Present summaries first, with details available upon request.

*   **README Content:** The README must have the following:
    *   High-level curriculum overview
    *   A prominent "Essential Resources" section highlighting Microsoft guidelines
    *   Quick navigation with clear callouts to design guidelines
    *   A "Getting started" workflow that references guidelines early

The "Essential Resources" section should be formatted as follows:

```markdown
## Essential Resources Before You Start
1. üìè **[Microsoft Design Guidelines](microsoft-design-guidelines.md)** - The foundation for all .NET code
2. üìö **[Curriculum Details](curriculum-details.md)** - What you'll build (detailed project breakdown)
3. üß† **[Language Essentials](language-essentials.md)** - Core .NET concepts you need to know
4. üéØ **[Progress Tracker](progress-tracker.md)** - Track your journey through the curriculum
```
The README should also contain these "Quick Reference Resources":

```

The README should also have a "Final Projects" section, with the following content:

```markdown
## Final Projects (Choose One)

After completing the 20 core projects, choose a capstone project:

- **Game Engine Architecture** - Combine multiple patterns into a cohesive game engine
- **Development Toolchain** - Build a complete development workflow with CI/CD
- **Performance-Critical Library** - Create a highly optimized library using advanced .NET features
```

The README should also have a "Project Structure" section, with the following content:

```markdown
Each project folder contains:
- **README.md** - Project overview and requirements
- **src/** - Implementation code
- **tests/** - Unit tests (when applicable)
- **docs/** - Project-specific documentation
```

The README should also have a "Contributing" section, with the following content:

```markdown
## Contributing

This curriculum is open for contributions! See individual project folders for specific contribution guidelines.
```

The README should also have a "Learning Support" section, with the following content:

```markdown
## Learning Support

- **Microsoft Guidelines Integration** - Each project explicitly references relevant design guidelines
- **Cross-References** - Documents link to related concepts across the curriculum
- **Progressive Disclosure** - Start simple, reference deeper material as needed
- **Practical Focus** - Every concept is taught through building real libraries and tools
```

*   **Unit Testing Framework:** All testing should be done with MSTest, not xUnit or nUnit etc.

*   For the first project in the curriculum, guide the user to create the directory structure and set up the projects themselves. For subsequent projects, provide template projects in the correct layout for them. **Ensure all curriculum documentation guides the user to create the correct directory layouts, as shown in the included project templates.**

*   Project 2 onward: provide template projects in the correct layout for them (only .sln and .csproj files). **All projects from project 2 onwards should follow the same directory layout.** **For projects that have templates (all aside from project 1) keep the instructions for how to create the solution and project layouts in case they need to be recreated, but note that the project template has been created to help streamline the lesson.**

*   **Project Directory Layout**:
    *   Project 1: User manually creates the directory structure and sets up the projects.
    *   Projects 2-20: Follow the same directory layout. The solution file and all project folders (e.g., Core, App, Tests) reside in the project's root directory, *not* within a `src` subdirectory.
        *   For projects where the intention is to make a library, include an App project to demo the functionality.

*   **Library Projects should have App Projects:** For projects where the intention is to make a library, always include an App project to demo the functionality.

*   **Library Projects should have App Projects:** For projects where the intention is to make a library, always include an App project to demo the functionality. **The App projects should contain just the project structure (folders and .csproj files) for the App demo projects, not the actual implementation code.**

*   **Empty Directories:** All empty `docs` and `tests` directories should be removed from the project structure. These directories will not be included in template projects.

*   **Comprehensive README Files:** The README files for each project must be the comprehensive guide for implementing the project and learning the desired concepts. Separate project guides should be used as reference when updating the READMEs and then removed. All READMEs should follow a similar format and structure and be comprehensive.

*   **README Consistency Check:** Ensure that the README files for projects 7-20 are consistent with the format and structure of the README files in earlier projects (1-6). The README files for projects 7-19 are currently not in line with the comprehensive format established in projects 1-6 and need to be updated. These projects are missing detailed implementation guides, "Testing Your Understanding" sections, "Extension Challenges", "Common Pitfalls & Solutions", comprehensive code examples, and contain shorter, less educational content. Project 18's README is currently empty and requires immediate attention.

*   **Projects Layout Analysis:**
    *   Complete Projects (with Core/App/Tests): Projects 3, 4, 5, 7 - Full three-tier structure
    *   Library Projects (Core + Tests + Solution): Projects 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20
    *   *Projects 6, 8, 9, 13, 19, 20 - Have Core libraries and solutions*
    *   *Projects 10, 11, 12, 14, 17, 18 - Just solution files and documentation*
    *   Minimal Projects (solution + README only): Projects 10, 11, 12, 14, 16, 17, 18 - Just solution files and documentation
    *   Documentation Only: Project 15, 16 - Currently has only README
        *   The above lists are now deprecated as all projects should now fit the complete projects structure.

*   **Updating READMEs for Implementation Guidance:** All projects should have comprehensive, self-contained READMEs with detailed implementation guides. The following projects currently need to be expanded to provide complete implementation guidance:
