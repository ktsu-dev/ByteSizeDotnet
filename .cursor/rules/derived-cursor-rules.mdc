## HEADERS

## TECH STACK

## PROJECT DOCUMENTATION & CONTEXT SYSTEM

*   The curriculum should contain a dedicated page similar to the quick reference for the Microsoft design and style guidelines for .NET libraries and applications.
*   The curriculum should have a glossary of terms too.
*   Update the main README to guide users to the quick reference, progress tracker, and design guidelines.

## BEST PRACTICES & GUIDELINES

When creating .NET learning curricula, prioritize the following:

*   **Focus:** Emphasize building libraries, tools, and games over web services.
*   **Time Commitment:** Design projects suitable for approximately 2 hours of evening work.
*   **ADHD Considerations:** Create small, approachable projects with a clear, single focus to facilitate learning and maintain engagement.
*   **Programming Fundamentals:** Minimize time spent on basic programming constructs (conditions, flow control, variables, types, methods). Instead, focus on their .NET-specific expressions and nomenclature.
*   **Advanced Concepts:** Prioritize topics like:
    *   Containers
    *   Async programming
    *   Extension methods
    *   Pattern matching
    *   Enumerables and deferred execution
    *   LINQ
    *   Fluent APIs
    *   Dependency Injection
    *   NuGet
    *   Reflection
    *   SOLID and DRY principles
    *   Lambdas
    *   Predicates
    *   Selectors
    *   Callbacks
*   **Curriculum Structure:** Structure concepts to build upon each other logically. Projects do not need to be related to each other thematically; unrelated projects may be preferable to minimize contextual distractions.

*   **Stack vs Heap Allocation:** When explaining value vs. reference semantics in the quick reference, always explain stack vs heap allocation *before* explaining value vs reference semantics. This provides necessary context.

*   **Terminology Reference Table:** The quick reference guide should include a table relating common .NET names (class, struct, method, parameter, property, field) to generic programming terms and their counterparts in other languages (e.g., Java, Python, JavaScript, C++, Go, Rust). This table should cover core types, code organization, modifiers, and advanced features and modern patterns. It should also include a section explaining key differences, such as properties being unique to .NET, struct differences between .NET and C++ struct differences between .NET and C++, namespace vs. package concepts, event system specifics, and LINQ as a unique .NET feature. Position the table after the naming conventions section in the quick reference. The language translation guide should mention records, containers, lambdas objects, built in types, tuples etc.

*   **Documentation Links:** The quick reference should provide quick links to Microsoft documentation for each topic. **The documents should always provide quick links to the Microsoft documentation. Reading the docs should be a fundamental theme of the curriculum.** Documentation links should be added throughout the curriculum, including in the main curriculum README and individual project READMEs, organized into logical categories. This reinforces documentation reading as a core skill.

*   The curriculum should contain a dedicated page similar to the quick reference for the Microsoft design and style guidelines for .NET libraries and applications.

*   Ensure the curriculum covers lambdas, predicates, selectors, callbacks, records, primary constructors, and other relevant modern .NET features.
