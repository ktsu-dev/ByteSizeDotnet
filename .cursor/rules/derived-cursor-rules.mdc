## HEADERS

## TECH STACK

## PROJECT DOCUMENTATION & CONTEXT SYSTEM

*   The curriculum should contain a dedicated page similar to the quick reference for the Microsoft design and style guidelines for .NET libraries and applications.
*   The curriculum should have a glossary of terms too.
*   Update the main README to guide users to the quick reference, progress tracker, and design guidelines.

## DEBUGGING

## BEST PRACTICES & GUIDELINES

When creating .NET learning curricula, prioritize the following:

*   **Focus:** Emphasize building libraries, tools, and games over web services.
*   **Time Commitment:** Design projects suitable for approximately 2 hours of evening work.
*   **ADHD Considerations:** Create small, approachable projects with a clear, single focus to facilitate learning and maintain engagement.
*   **Programming Fundamentals:** Minimize time spent on basic programming constructs (conditions, flow control, variables, types, methods). Instead, focus on their .NET-specific expressions and nomenclature.
*   **Advanced Concepts:** Prioritize topics like:
    *   Containers
    *   Async programming
    *   Extension methods
    *   Pattern matching
    *   Enumerables and deferred execution
    *   LINQ
    *   Fluent APIs
    *   Dependency Injection
    *   NuGet
    *   Reflection
    *   SOLID and DRY principles
    *   Lambdas
    *   Predicates
    *   Selectors
    *   Callbacks
*   **Curriculum Structure:** Structure concepts to build upon each other logically. Projects do not need to be related to each other thematically; unrelated projects may be preferable to minimize contextual distractions.

*   **Stack vs Heap Allocation:** When explaining value vs. reference semantics in the quick reference, always explain stack vs heap allocation *before* explaining value vs reference semantics. This provides necessary context.

*   **Terminology Reference Table:** The quick reference guide should include a table relating common .NET names (class, struct, method, parameter, property, field) to generic programming terms and their counterparts in other languages (e.g., Java, Python, JavaScript, C++, Go, Rust). This table should cover core types, code organization, modifiers, and advanced features and modern patterns. It should also include a section explaining key differences, such as properties being unique to .NET, struct differences between .NET and C++ struct differences between .NET and C++, namespace vs. package concepts, event system specifics, and LINQ as a unique .NET feature. Position the table after the naming conventions section in the quick reference. The language translation guide should mention records, containers, lambdas objects, built in types, tuples etc.

*   **Documentation Links:** The quick reference should provide quick links to Microsoft documentation for each topic. **The documents should always provide quick links to the Microsoft documentation. Reading the docs should be a fundamental theme of the curriculum.** Documentation links should be added throughout the curriculum, including in the main curriculum README and individual project READMEs, organized into logical categories. This reinforces documentation reading as a core skill.

*   The curriculum should contain a dedicated page similar to the quick reference for the Microsoft design and style guidelines for .NET libraries and applications.

*   Ensure the curriculum covers lambdas, predicates, selectors, callbacks, records, primary constructors, and other relevant modern .NET features.

*   **Document Structure & Layout:** The project should adhere to the following document structure:

    *   **README.md:** Streamlined high-level curriculum overview, learning philosophy, quick navigation to other documents, and a "Getting started" section (approximately 200 lines).
    *   **curriculum-details.md:** Detailed project information, phase-by-phase breakdown, learning objectives, and deliverables (approximately 400 lines).
    *   **microsoft-design-guidelines.md:** Keep as standalone file with current comprehensive content (approximately 700 lines). Add curriculum cross-references (which projects use which guidelines) and maybe add a "Quick Start" section at the top for immediate needs.
    *   **language-essentials.md:** Core .NET concepts needed for the curriculum, essential syntax and patterns, and cross-references to full reference docs (approximately 300 lines). Heavy cross-references to Microsoft guidelines. "See design-guidelines.md for the full story" type callouts.
    *   **reference/:** A directory containing focused reference files:
        *   **reference/glossary.md:** Term definitions (approximately 300 lines - current size).
        *   **reference/language-comparison.md:** Language mappings from the quick-reference (approximately 400 lines).
        *   **reference/quick-syntax.md:** Syntax examples (approximately 300 lines).
    *   **progress-tracker.md:** Current progress tracking (approximately 300 lines). Add "Guidelines Checklist" for each project and links to specific guideline sections.

    This structure promotes shorter, focused documents with a clear purpose for each file, progressive disclosure of information, and easy maintenance.

    When restructuring documents, consider these principles:
    *   **Minimize Redundancy:** Remove duplicate content, especially between naming conventions in multiple files.
    *   **Establish Clear Hierarchies:** Present basic concepts before advanced topics.
    *   **Incorporate Cross-References:** Link related concepts to improve understanding.
    *   **Separate Concerns:** Distinguish between reference material and curriculum content.
    *   **Maintain Consistent Formatting:** Ensure uniform formatting across all documents.
    *   **Utilize Headers Effectively:** Employ headers for clear navigation.
    *   **Include Tables of Contents:** Add tables of contents to longer documents.
    *   **Use Visual Indicators:** Use icons or formatting to differentiate content types.
    *   **Provide Quick Navigation:** Include a quick navigation section in the README.
    *   **Differentiate "What You Need" vs "Reference":** Clearly distinguish between essential information and reference material.
    *   **Optimize for Search:** Use search-friendly headings and keywords.
    *   **Employ Progressive Disclosure:** Present summaries first, with details available upon request.

*   **README Content:** The README must have the following:
    *   High-level curriculum overview
    *   A prominent "Essential Resources" section highlighting Microsoft guidelines
    *   Quick navigation with clear callouts to design guidelines
    *   A "Getting started" workflow that references guidelines early

The "Essential Resources" section should be formatted as follows:

```markdown
## Essential Resources Before You Start
1. üìè **[Microsoft Design Guidelines](microsoft-design-guidelines.md)** - The foundation for all .NET code
2. üìö **[Curriculum Details](curriculum-details.md)** - What you'll build (detailed project breakdown)
