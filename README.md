# .NET Byte-Size Curriculum

_A progressive learning path for .NET development focused on libraries, tools, and games_

## Overview

This curriculum is designed for 2-hour evening sessions with ADHD-friendly, focused projects. Each project teaches one core concept while building practical applications.

## Learning Philosophy

- **Single Focus**: Each project teaches one main concept
- **Independent Projects**: No project dependencies to maintain focus
- **Practical Applications**: Libraries, tools, and games over web services
- **Progressive Complexity**: Concepts build upon each other logically
- **Template-Driven**: Pre-configured project templates (Projects 2-20) streamline setup and let you focus on learning

## Essential Resources Before You Start

1. üìè **[Microsoft Design Guidelines](microsoft-design-guidelines.md)** - The foundation for all .NET code
2. üìö **[Curriculum Details](curriculum-details.md)** - What you'll build (detailed project breakdown)
3. üß† **[Language Essentials](language-essentials.md)** - Core .NET concepts you need to know
4. üéØ **[Progress Tracker](progress-tracker.md)** - Track your journey through the curriculum

## Quick Reference Resources

5. üìñ **[Reference Directory](reference/)** - Deep-dive references when you need them
   - **[Glossary](reference/glossary.md)** - .NET terminology explained
   - **[Language Comparison](reference/language-comparison.md)** - How .NET maps to other languages
   - **[Quick Syntax](reference/quick-syntax.md)** - Handy syntax reference

## Project Structure

**Template Information**: All projects except Project 1 include pre-configured .NET solution templates:

```
project-xx-name/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ProjectName.sln              # Solution file with references
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ProjectName.Core/            # Main library (.NET 8.0)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ProjectName.App/             # Console app for testing
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ProjectName.Tests/           # Unit tests (MSTest)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md                    # Detailed instructions
```

**Project 1** requires manual setup to teach foundational .NET project creation skills. **Projects 2-20** include templates so you can focus on implementation and learning concepts rather than project configuration.
